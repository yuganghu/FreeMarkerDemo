A demo of FreeMarker - An open source template engine

FreeMarker is an open source template engine, which can generate text output based on templates. 
As you guys probably notice, lots of pages are very similar within the same web sites. 
If you designed lots of web pages already, often times you will find pages you need to create are very similar. 
Of course, that could be done through lots of other ways, for example, JSP, Apache Tiles, Velocity, Jamon, etc, 
however I am going to only cover FreeMarker here.
